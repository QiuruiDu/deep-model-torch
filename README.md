# deep-model-torch
pytorch implements of some popular deep network , mainly for  ctr and other prediction, for example DCN, etc. What I want to mention is that this project is mainly used for learning the algorithm, not the higher result and lower loss.

the using example:
``python main.py --model_type dcn --early_stopping 4``
